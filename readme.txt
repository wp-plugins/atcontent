== Description ==

### Make Money and Protect Your Content! ###

AtContent plugin gives you the opportunity to take a step in the future of the digital content world. Read features below, try it and never come back to the old world.

#### Protect your content & Monetize reposts ####

* Readers repost your copy-protected content legally and for a fee.
* [Demo example](http://smpl1.azurewebsites.net/TechCrunch/Default.cshtml?id=879168829694354F6.text) — text is not available for copying, but everyone can click on “share & repost” at the bottom of the published content. This protects your content from plagiarism. 

#### Increase search ranking for your site ####

* Each repost contains a backlink to your site. No penalties from Google.

#### Track and manage your publications across the Internet ####

* You are notified every time somebody shares or reposts your content. You see statistics showing who does it, when at where it happens. You can update your content and even block specific articles from being shared and reposted.
* [Demo example 1](http://test.ariser.ru/Stat/graph.html)
* [Demo example 2](http://test.ariser.ru/Stat/)

#### Sell your premium content ####

* AtContent makes it easy to sell your premium articles and even files attached to your content. Most importantly, your users can resell your content and increase your earning even more! You can withdraw your money from your PayPal account anytime.
* [Demo example](http://smpl1.azurewebsites.net/TechCrunch/Default.cshtml?id=879168829469878VP.text)

#### Reach new audience ####

* The comments people leave on your posts appear on every site where posts are copied. Users on different sites will discuss your content in the comment section on their site and you will collaborate with them all by replying on your site! How cool is that?
* [Demo example](https://atcontent.com/EmbedTour/#Comments)

#### Free backup in AtContent cloud ####

== Frequently asked questions ==

= I have an issue with "selling" content that is not mine (I have guest authors on my site who may not appreciate the appearance of me selling their content without their permission). I'll get back to you on this. =

AtContent settings are different for each user in WordPress blog. If you have two different users in your blog you should setup API Key for each user separately. And posts from each author will be in different AtContent accounts.
If you have "guests" publications on your blog, you can not use AtContent plugin for it. Each publication has AtContent plugin settings in editing mode and you can turn it on or off as, as you need. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ZFzZc.png)
