Grow your audience and traffic with just a few clicks. Easily repost content via relevant blogs, across all blogging platforms!

== Description ==

#### How AtContent Works ####

AtContent enables bloggers to make reposts.
The “repost” is equivalent to a full size blog post.

You can see who reposts your content, how many times it has been reposted, and the number of views it has received. If you update the content, all reposts will be updated automatically.

1.	Sign up and connect your blog to AtContent with a few clicks. 
2.	Discover and follow like-minded bloggers in your niche, creating a personal AtContent Feed for reposting.
3.	Repost content from AtContent Feed to increase page views and the amount of time people spend on your blog.

By reposting content, you increase page views, social sharing and time people spend on your blog, simply because now you have more content on your blog!

[Our bloggers with quality content get up to 100x reposts and 100,000 views in 2 months](http://bit.ly/1pj4lbV)!

#### About Reposts ####

Each repost is signed with the author’s name and looks native on any blog. AtContent uses JavaScript, nofollow and canonical tags for all reposts. Therefore, it doesn’t affect SEO.

== Installation ==

1. Install the AtContent plugin on your blog and activate it,
2. Connect the plugin to AtContent to start using it - [Screenshot](http://bit.ly/LtC3hF),
3. You are done!

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why wouldn't Google penalize my site for content duplication? =

At AtContent we use “nofollow” and “canonical” tags for all links in reposts. We avoid content duplication by using JavaScript technology and show search engines the original source of content. Thus, reposts don’t affect your SEO at all.
