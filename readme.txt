#### Protect your content & Monetize reposts ####

* Readers repost your copy-protected content legally for free or for a fee.
* [Demo example 1](http://alexeysemeney.blogspot.ru/2013/02/new-atcontent-plugin-for-wordpress.html) – text is not available for copying, but everyone can click on “share & repost” at the bottom of the published content and repost the whole article legally. This protects your content from plagiarism. 
* [Demo example 2](http://smpl1.azurewebsites.net/TechCrunch/Default.cshtml?id=879168829694354F6.text) — the same, as in Demo example 1, but to repost the publication user must pay. This protects your content from plagiarism and bring you money.

#### Reach new audience ####

* The comments people leave on your posts appear on every site where posts are copied. Users on different sites will discuss your content in the comment section on their site and you will collaborate with them all by replying on your site! How cool is that?

== Frequently asked questions ==

= I have an issue with "selling" content that is not mine (I have guest authors on my site who may not appreciate the appearance of me selling their content without their permission). I'll get back to you on this. =

AtContent settings are different for each user in WordPress blog. If you have two different users in your blog you should setup API Key for each user separately. And posts from each author will be in different AtContent accounts.
If you have "guests" publications on your blog, you can not use AtContent plugin for it. Each publication has AtContent plugin settings in editing mode and you can turn it on or off as, as you need. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ZFzZc.png)
