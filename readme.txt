### Make Money and Protect Your Content!  ###

AtContent plugin allows you to make step in the future of the world of content. 
Read features below, try it and never come back to the old world.

#### Protect your content & Monetize reposts ####

* Readers repost your content legally for a fee and it’s protected from copying and pasting functions.
* [Demo example](http://smpl1.azurewebsites.net/TechCrunch/Default.cshtml?id=879168829694354F6.text) — no one can copy text, but everyone can click on “share & repost” at the bottom of the published content. This protects your content from plagiarism.

#### Increase search ranking for your site ####

* Each repost contains a backlink to your site. No penalties from Google.

#### Track and manage your publications across the Internet ####

* Every time somebody shares or reposts your content you will know. You will see statistics showing who, when, where. You can update your content and even block specific articles from being published.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= I have an issue with "selling" content that is not mine (I have guest authors on my site who may not appreciate the appearance of me selling their content without their permission). I'll get back to you on this. =

AtContent settings are different for each user in WordPress blog. If you have two different users in your blog you should setup API Key for each user separately. And posts from each author will be in different AtContent accounts.
If you have "guests" publications on your blog, you can not use AtContent plugin for it. Each publication has AtContent plugin settings in editing mode and you can turn it on or off as, as you need. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ZFzZc.png)
